# StringEvaluation
Coding Challenge.  Evaluate a string to determine if it contains 2-numbers that add to exactly 10 and that have 3-? between them.  For example 'di5k?d?d?5dj' would return "true" since 5 + 5 = 10 and there are three ? between the 5's.

'j4d???7?3djf??7?djwio' would return false.  7 + 3 does add to 10 but there is only 1-? between the 7 and 3.  Next 3 & 7 add to 10 but there are 2-? between them.

Simple console app.  Run, enter string, press enter.
